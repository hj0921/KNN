#### KNN Examples
KNN is applied to:
1. Dating Web Data
2. Hand Written Digit Data

#### KNN Basic Theory
KNN is a supervised learning that does not have the learning process. This algorithm classify different classes based on the calculated distance between the classifying point and all the training points, and it only considers k nearest neighbors. Therefore, the magnitude of the K is important to this algorithm.

#### Three key points to KNN
